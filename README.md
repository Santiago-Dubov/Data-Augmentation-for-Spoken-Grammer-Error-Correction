# Data-Augmentation-for-Spoken-Grammer-Error-Correction

The project aims to improve on existing results for the automated grammar correction of non-native english speech that has been transcribed using ASR.

The tools here have been created to aid in pre-processing corpora and also include an implementation of the grammatical error generation method developed by Chloe et al
in the 2019 BEA task to create pseudo data.
